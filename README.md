# Information Retrieval System

Technology - Python 2.7
Tools used : Pycharm
Category : Academic Project

Requirement:
For a given set of 3000 text documents, need to develop a information
retrieval system that would execute the user queries and return the
documents that match the user query. Need to use different information
retrieval models like Cosine Vector Similarity Model, Tfidf, BM25,
Lucene and measure the performance of each model for a set of user
queries provided by the client. Further study the effect of using
techniques like stopping, stemming and query expansion techniques like
pseudo relevance feedback on the retrieval system. Use standard metrics
like Precision, Recall, Mean Reciprocal Rank etc. to measure
effectiveness of each model in the system.

Provided: Set of 3204 text documents.

Output:
Reports with Top 100 document ids for each query using each information
retrieval model and a single report depicting the performance of each
model in the system.

Note: Lucene was implemented using Java.
